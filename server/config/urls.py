"""
Root URL configuration.

Layout:
    /admin/       Django admin — free CRUD over every model, useful for
                  debugging a deployment without the SPA.
    /healthz/     Liveness probe   (deliberately outside /api/)
    /readyz/      Readiness probe  (deliberately outside /api/)
    /api/         Everything the SPA talks to
    /api/docs/    Swagger UI

Health probes sit at the root rather than under /api/ on purpose: they must
not depend on the API's authentication stack, DRF content negotiation, or the
/api prefix surviving a reverse-proxy rewrite.
